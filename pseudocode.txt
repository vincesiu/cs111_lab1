put on command stack

If encounter new operator:
	If operator stack == NULL:
		Add new operator to operator_stack
	Else
		If Precedence(new operator) > precedence(top op):
			Add new operator to operator_stack
		Else
			While top op != (  &&
				precedence(new op) <= precedence (top op):
				operator = operator_stack.pop()
				second_command= command_stack.pop()
				first_command = command_stack.pop()
				new_command = combine(first_com, second_com, ....)
				comand_stack.push(new_command)
				top_operator = operator_stack.peek()
				if top_operator == NULL:
					break
		operator_stack.push(new operator)
		blah blah

process whatever left in operator stack
