CS111 Lab 1A: Implementation of parsing of command line input.  Comments: No
known limitations as far as we know. At the moment of writing, it recognizes
all syntactical errors. 

CS111 Lab 1B: Implentation of execution of command line input.  Comments: All
the commands except for pipe and subshell are robustly. Implementing subshell
was good as well. However, subshell and pipe and io redirects have very
complicated interactions, and we are not sure if we accounted for every side
case. However, after much experimentation with test cases, we believe that our
pipe and io redirection implementation is consistent with sh.
